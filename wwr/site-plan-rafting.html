            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>To encourage people to be more adventurous on vacation. The site should show potential customers how exciting a rafting trip can be.  The company should show different levels of trips from beginner to advanced. The site should promote our companies experience, and track record with safety. The site should also provide nostalgic value to previous customers, encouraging them to come back for another trip.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>Our main target audience would be people age 16-60 who are looking for an adventurous vacation. They should have enough freedom to take a week off, and enough disposable income to afford the trip and travel to our location. They would be people who enjoy the water and the outdoors. 
                What do these customers want? They want the feeling of doing something daring, with the confidence that they will be with professionals, and will be safe. They want a story they will be able to tell their family or co-workers after the trip. 
                What do they expect to find on the website? They will be looking for something to separate us from the other companies, something that makes us unique. Again, this is all about giving the user confidence that they will be able to succesfully navigate the trip. 
                What are their needs that aren't being met? They need a site that will show all levels of customers, from beginner to experienced, and to explain that they will be put in a group with similar experience, while having expert guides. </p>

            <p>Maine is a beautiful state that offers plenty of beautiful scenery. There are many things you can do in Maine, such as swim in the ocean, hike one of the many beautiful trails, eat great seafood, visit one of our famous lighthouses, or be the first to see the sun rise in the morning. People in Maine are very friendly and down to earth. It's a great place to live, or visit on vacation.</p>
